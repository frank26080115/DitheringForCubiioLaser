Modified for Cubiio
===================

I forked and modified this project from Cyotek https://github.com/cyotek/Dithering

I modified it to scale the images so it works nicer with a Cubiio laser engraver

The original README is below

Image Dithering using C#
========================

This sample program demonstrates how to use various algorithms to dither an image using C#.
